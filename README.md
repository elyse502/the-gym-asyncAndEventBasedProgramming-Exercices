<h1 align="center"><sup>⏳</sup><i>Async and Event Based Programming</i><sup>👂</sup></h1>

In JavaScript, a `Promise` is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. It acts as a placeholder for a value that may not be available yet but will be resolved (successful) or rejected (failed) at some point in the future.

`Asynchronous programming` in JavaScript refers to a non-blocking execution model where certain tasks can be initiated and run in the background without halting the main program's execution. This allows the program to remain responsive and perform other operations while waiting for potentially long-running tasks, such as network requests, file I/O, or database queries, to complete.
